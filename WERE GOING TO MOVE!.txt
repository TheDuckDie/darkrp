READ THIS SHIT CAREFULLY! MAKE CHANGES BEFORE OCTOBER 24TH! WE'RE GOING TO MOVE SHORTLY AFTER THE RELEASE OF GMOD 13!
WHICH IS OCTOBER 24TH.

I don't like SVN.
I like git more.
We're going to move to github.

If you don't know what git is then
	look it up on Google.

This is where we're going to move to:
	https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP

Try to go along with the change and use git. There's a nice program for it:
	http://windows.github.com/
	The download button is on the top right.

If you're a stubborn fuckwit and you still want to use SVN, you can do that, but don't stick with this address.
Here are the addresses:
	GMod 12 version (And GMod 13 version after October 24th)
		https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP/trunk

	Gmod 13 Beta version (will be removed after October 24th)
		https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP/branches/beta

HOW TO STICK WITH SVN IF YOU'RE THAT STUBBORN: (TortoiseSVN guide)
	0. Backup your shit and don't blame your stupid mistakes on me.
	1. Right click the folder in which this very file is located
	2. Hover your mouse over that little text that says "TortoiseSVN". You'll see a little submenu
	3. Click SVN Relocate.
	4. Enter one of the URL's given above.
	5. Press the god damn OK button.
